# Vigenère Breaker

A web app to help you crack Vigenère ciphers.

## What is this?

This is a web app that you can use to help crack text encrypted with the Vigenère ciphers. It's intended for people who
want to have fun cracking the ciphers while automating the boring and tedious parts. The Vigenère ciphers is actually
relatively weak by modern standards, and thus can often be automatically fully solved via statistical analysis. If you
want a tool that just automatically solves the cipher for you, **this is not the tool for you**. Consider using
[Boxentriq's solver](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher)'s "Auto Solve" feature instead.

But if you want to have fun participating in the solving process, then you might enjoy using this app!

Here is a Youtube video demonstrating how to use the app:

## Roadmap

I actually feel like this app is fairly complete now. So I don't have any plans on the roadmap. If you have any ideas
for features, please [file an issue](https://github.com/NebuPookins/vigenere-breaker/issues).
